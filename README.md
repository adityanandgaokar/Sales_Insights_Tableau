I have created the dashboard with the help of eight sheets which are year, month, sales quantity by market, sales quantity, total revenue, top 5 products sales amount,
top 5 customer sales amount, sales amount at every month.
In the dashboard year and month, sheets are used as filters.

The images of tableau dashboards you can see in the below link or issue section or with the help of dashboard1 and dashboard2 files.
